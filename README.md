# CS210-Project-3
The project was suppose to find out how many oh each item was bought that day. The user wanted to be able to seach up for one item or show all items and how many were sold. I beleive I made the program very modular and easy to read and easily able to switch out the file if needed as well as cutting down on the amount of classes that are in it. I think i could have made the file input better by making it into its own function and just calling it at the beginning out each menu function. I tried using a map for the second function but wasnt able to get it to work properly and increment each time i encountered an item that was already in the map. I ended up using a vector instead which to me was a lot simpler. To me working with files is a very good skill to have and I think I have utilized it pretty well in these last two programs. Making the program have less files that ou have to sort through makes it easier to read and maintain. As well as making everything concise and easy to undrstand. I did just realize i forgot to make comments on a lot of the code but adding more comments would make it a lot easier to read and understand.
